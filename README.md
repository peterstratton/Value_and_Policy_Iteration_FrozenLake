# Value_and_Policy_Iteration_FrozenLake

This repository contains implementations of value iteration and policy iteration that are ran in the  FrozenLake Open AI gym environment: https://gym.openai.com/envs/FrozenLake8x8-v0/. Gym environments are test problems that all contain a general interface. This provides a space to run and test a variety of different types of RL algorithms. For more info on gym environments, check here: https://gym.openai.com/docs/.
